# Project 1 - *Guess-Text*

Submitted by: **Pragnavi Ravuluri Sai Durga**

**Guess-Text** is an app that recreates the popular word puzzle game Wordle. In this game, players attempt to guess a secret word within a limited number of tries. Each guess provides feedback to the player, indicating which letters are correctly placed, which are in the word but in the wrong position, and which are not in the word at all. The app features a keyboard interface for inputting guesses and a grid display that shows the progress and feedback for each guess. The goal is to correctly guess the word in as few tries as possible. Additionally, the app includes a WordGenerator component that selects a new, random word for each game session, ensuring a unique challenge each time. The game is designed to be both engaging and challenging, testing players' vocabulary and deductive reasoning skills.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

During the development of the Wordle app, I encountered several challenges, primarily due to my beginner status in Swift programming. Grasping the syntax of Swift was particularly difficult at the outset. Understanding the logic and flow of the code was also a hurdle, as reading and interpreting Swift code wasn't intuitive for me initially. However, I tackled these challenges by diligently referring to Swift documentation and various online resources. This approach helped me gradually build my understanding and become more comfortable with the language and the app's logic. Over time, I managed to overcome these initial obstacles and make significant progress in developing the app.
